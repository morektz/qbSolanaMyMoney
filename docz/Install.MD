# Installation Instruction

When opening this file in gitpod the yaml ensures all the rquired pacakges are installed, but the path doesnt get set 
due to permission issues.

This is being fixed by making a bash script that sets the actual path. This need to be run everytime a new shell is
opened 

Command

`$. ./SetSolanaPath`
